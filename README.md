## Overview
The study aims to optimize multivariate function minimization by iteratively solving for each variable while holding others constant. This approach is particularly useful in the context of regularization techniques like Lasso and Elastic Net, which are essential for feature selection and managing multicollinearity in predictive modeling.

## Problem Statement
The Coordinate Descent algorithm is a crucial optimization technique for regression problems where feature selection and regularization are required. Lasso and Elastic Net are widely used regression methods that benefit from the Coordinate Descent approach due to its efficiency in handling large datasets with high dimensionality. This project investigates the effectiveness of this algorithm in the context of:

Lasso Regression: Minimizing the sum of squared errors with an L1 penalty, which encourages sparsity in the model by shrinking some coefficients to zero.
Elastic Net Regression: Combining L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties to address the limitations of Lasso, especially in datasets with highly correlated predictors.
## Methodology
Algorithm Implementation
Lasso Regression:

The Lasso method applies an L1 penalty to encourage sparsity in the model, making it effective for feature selection.
The Coordinate Descent algorithm was implemented to iteratively minimize the objective function with respect to each variable.
Elastic Net Regression:

Elastic Net combines the penalties of Lasso and Ridge regression, providing a balance between feature selection and model complexity.
The Coordinate Descent algorithm was extended to handle both L1 and L2 penalties, optimizing the regularization parameters alpha (for Ridge) and lambda (for Lasso).
Simulation Setup
Data Simulation: Synthetic datasets were generated with varying degrees of correlation and noise to test the robustness of the Lasso and Elastic Net models.
Model Evaluation: The performance of the models was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the number of non-zero coefficients, with the goal of finding the optimal regularization parameters.
Performance Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE): The primary metric used to assess the accuracy of the models in predicting the response variable.
Number of Non-Zero Coefficients: Used to evaluate the sparsity of the models, particularly relevant for Lasso and Elastic Net where feature selection is a key goal.
## Results
Lasso Regression:

Consistently performed well in selecting relevant features, with the number of non-zero coefficients closely matching the true underlying model in simulated data.
Achieved a minimal MSE of 0.03 in scenarios with moderate noise and feature correlation.
Elastic Net Regression:

Demonstrated flexibility in handling highly correlated features, outperforming Lasso in scenarios with strong feature correlation.
The optimal combination of L1 and L2 penalties led to a 15% reduction in MSE compared to Lasso alone in specific high-correlation settings.
## Conclusion
The Coordinate Descent algorithm proves to be an efficient and effective optimization technique for Lasso and Elastic Net regression models, particularly in high-dimensional settings where feature selection is critical. While Lasso is effective for sparse models, Elastic Net offers a more balanced approach when dealing with correlated predictors, providing better overall model performance in such cases.
